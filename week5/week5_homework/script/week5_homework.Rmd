### CALL ALL THE PACKAGE LIBRARIES 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)   #lots of function to tidying the data
library(here)        #to read the data using here(), to connect with github folder
library(lubridate)   #to assign datetime format
library(ggplot2)     #to use ggplot package, create the plot
library(gganimate) # to use the animation package
library(gifski) #need this to render for the gif output 
library(av) #need this to show the video visual
```

### READ AND INSPECT THE DATA
```{r}
#Read conductivity data
Cond_df <- read_csv(here("week5", "week5_homework", "data", "CondData.csv"))

#Read depth data
Dept_df <- read_csv(here("week5", "week5_homework", "data", "DepthData.csv"))

#Inspect data
glimpse(Cond_df)  #inspect conductivity data
glimpse(Dept_df)  #inspect depth data

#NOTES based on the data inspection: "date" in conductivity is still in character, while in depth is already in datetime format. So we need to change the format "date" of cond_df into datetime

#apply datetime format at "date" column
Cond_df <- Cond_df %>%
  mutate(date = mdy_hms(date)) %>%             #assign the datetime format at "date" column
  mutate(date = round_date(date, "10 sec"))    #round to the nearest 10 seconds
  

glimpse(Cond_df)  #inspect the data again, here the "date" is in the datetime format. 
```

### JOIN THE TWO DATAFRAMES
```{r}
All_df <- inner_join(Cond_df, Dept_df, by = "date")  #use semi_join() to not join data with NAs
anyNA(All_df)  #double check, if there is NAs in the data, resuld shows "FALSE", meaning no NAs.
glimpse(All_df)
```
### Calculate the average of date, depth, temperature, and salinity by minutes
```{r}
Summarized_df <- All_df %>%                            #use the All_df to create new summarized_df
  mutate(date_minute = floor_date(date, "minute")) %>% #round to the nearest minutes, assign it to new column
  group_by(date_minute) %>%                            #group by minutes, using the new column "date_minute" 
  summarise(                                           #summarize, using summarise() function
    mean_temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),    #calculate mean temperature by following grouped column 
    mean_sali = mean(Salinity, na.rm = TRUE),       #calculate mean salinity by following grouped column
    mean_press = mean(AbsPressure, na.rm = TRUE),   #calculate mean pressure by following grouped column
    mean_dept = mean(Depth, na.rm = TRUE)           #calculate mean depth by following grouped column
  )
  
```

#Create the plot!
```{r}
animated_plot <- ggplot(data = Summarized_df, # using the summarized data
       mapping = aes(x = date_minute,         #assign the x-axis with timeframe
                     y = bill_length_mm, #assign the y-axis with bill length (mm)
                     size = body_mass_g, #assign the size following the body mass (gr)
                     color = sex))  +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + #this is to set the transparency of the geom point
  scale_colour_manual(values = beyonce_palette(2)) + #to set the color based on beyonce palette
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + #to set the size of geom point based on mass, from 2 to 12
  facet_wrap(~species) + #to facet the grid by species
  labs(title = "Bill and Body Mass Dimension", #to assign the title of the figures
       subtitle = 'Year: {frame_time}',        #to add subtitle with the adjusting year
       x = 'Bill Depth (mm)',                  #to rename the x axis label
       y = 'Bill Length (mm)',                 #to rename the y axis label
       color = "Sex",                          #to rename the sex legend
       size = "Body Mass (gr)",                #to rename the size legend
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER/ palmerpenguins package") + #to add caption below the data frame)
  transition_time(year) + #to set the time transition by year
  ease_aes('linear') + # to ensures that all changes progress evenly over time without any acceleration or deceleration.
  theme_bw() #to use the theme_bw() as the base figures
```
