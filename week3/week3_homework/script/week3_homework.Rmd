##### LOAD LIBRARIES #####

library(palmerpenguins) #to use the palmerpenguin data
library(ggplot2) #to use ggplot package
library(gganimate) # to use the animation package
library(tidyverse) #lots of function to tidying the data
library(here) #to connect with github folder
library(devtools) #to call other package, Im using this to call beyonce color palette
library(ps) #need this if I want to use the devtools (it is mentioned in the warning)
library(gifski) #need this to render for the gif output 
library(av) #need this to show the video visual
library(beyonce) #need this to use beyonce color palatte
library(ggthemes) #need this to use the theme in the base of data frame

```

```{r}
###### INSPECT THE DATA #######
###inspect the data
view(penguins)
head(penguins)
tail(penguins)
glimpse(penguins)

#After inspect the data, I want to make a visualization about the bill depth and bill length of each species in different island. in Other words, I want to use the x- axis as the bill depth, y-axis as the bill length and colored the data point by location, then faceted it by species. I will also put the linear model and placing the geom smooth, and do the transformation of the data. 

```

```{r}
### CREATE THE PLOT ####
animated_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, # using penguins data
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,  #assign the x-axis with bill depth (mm)
                     y = bill_length_mm, #assign the y-axis with bill length (mm)
                     size = body_mass_g, #assign the size following the body mass (gr)
                     color = sex))  +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + #this is to set the transparency of the geom point
  scale_colour_manual(values = beyonce_palette(2)) + #to set the color based on beyonce palette
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + #to set the size of geom point based on mass, from 2 to 12
  facet_wrap(~species) + #to facet the grid by species
  labs(title = "Bill and Body Mass Dimension", #to assign the title of the figures
       subtitle = 'Year: {frame_time}',        #to add subtitle with the adjusting year
       x = 'Bill Depth (mm)',                  #to rename the x axis label
       y = 'Bill Length (mm)',                 #to rename the y axis label
       color = "Sex",                          #to rename the sex legend
       size = "Body Mass (gr)",                #to rename the size legend
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER/ palmerpenguins package") + #to add caption below the data frame)
  transition_time(year) + #to set the time transition by year
  ease_aes('linear') + # to ensures that all changes progress evenly over time without any acceleration or deceleration.
  theme_bw() #to use the theme_bw() as the base figures

animate(animated_plot) #to render the animated plot, can check the result in the viewer

anim_save(here("week3","week3_homework", "output"),
