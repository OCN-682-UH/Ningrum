### load libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)         #need this to use %>%
library(tidyr)         #need this to tidy the data
library(ggplot2)       #to use ggplot package
library(tidyverse)     #lots of function to tidying the data
library(here)          #to connect with github folder

```

### Read the data and inspect the data
```{r}
#Read the data and assign it as "df"
df <- read_csv(here("week4", "week4_homework_b", "data", "chemicaldata_maunalua.csv"))   

##Inspect the data
head(df)    #to check the first 6 rows of the data
tail(df)    #to check the last 6 rows of the data
glimpse(df) #to see the overall data

```
### Data Cleaning, Remove all NAs, Separate the tide_time column, filtered out data
```{r}
df_clean <- df %>%                                      #create a clean dataset by using the df data
  drop_na() %>%                                         #removes all the Na(s)
  separate(Tide_time, into = c("Tide", "Time"),         #separate the "Tide_time column into "Tide" and "Time
           sep = "_") %>%                               #separate after these sign "_"
  select(Temp_in, Salinity, Zone, Tide, Time, Season)   #Select only these column

View(df_clean)                                          #check the clean dataset
glimpse(df_clean)                                       #review the clean dataset
```

### Make a summary statistics and export the csv
```{r}
#create a summary statistic (descriptive statistic)
summary_stats <- df_clean %>%               #create a new dataset using df_clean, then
  group_by(Zone, Season, Time, Tide) %>%    #group by xone, season, time and tide, then
  summarise(                                #create a summary, where
    #temperature summary
    temp_mean = mean(Temp_in),              #calculate the mean of temperature
    temp_sd = sd(Temp_in),                  #calculate the standard deviation of temperature
    temp_median = median(Temp_in),          #calculate the median of temperature
    temp_max = max(Temp_in),                #calculate the highest temperature
    temp_min = min(Temp_in),                #calculate the lowest temperature
    
    #salinity summary
    salinity_mean = mean(Salinity),         #calculate the mean of salinity
    salinity_sd = sd(Salinity),             #calculate the standard deviation of salinity
    Salinity_median = median(Salinity),     #calculate the median of salinity
    salinity_max = max(Salinity),           #calculate the hihest value of salinity
    salinity_min = min(Salinity)            #calculate the lowest value of salinity
  )

#check the data  
View(summary_stats)

#export the csv into assigned folder
write_csv(summary_stats, here("week4", "week4_homework_b", "output", "summary_stats.csv"))

```

### Make a plot
```{r}

#create the plot using ggplot
temp_salinity <- ggplot(df_clean,                            #create a plot using ggplot, use data from df_clean
       aes(x = Temp_in, y = Salinity,       #assign the x axis as the temperature, and y axis as the salinity
           color = Time, shape = Tide)) +   #show different color by time, and different shape by tide
  geom_point(size = 1.5) +                  #Add the data point and adjust point size
  facet_grid(Zone ~ Season) +               #Facet by Zone and Season
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Temperature and Salinity",                #add title
       subtitle = "in four zones (Ambient, Diffuse, Offshore, and Transition)",#add subtitle
       x = "Temperature (Â°C)",                                                 #add x axis label
       y = "Salinity (ppt)") +                                                 #add y axis label
  theme_gray()                                                                 #use a gray theme

#check the plot
temp_salinity   

#Save the plot in the correct output folder
ggsave( filename =  here("week4", "week4_homework_b", "output", "temp_salinity.png"), 
       plot = temp_salinity, width = 7, height = 5)
```
