# Direction
Take any data sheets you have already worked with, create at least one table and one figure in Rmarkdown file. Create in either html, github foc, or pdf format (you must knit the file). Make sure you have headings with clear explainations of what you are doing. Practice the bold, italics, and lists. make sure your outputs and script are saved in the appropriate folders. keep proper coding etiquette.
